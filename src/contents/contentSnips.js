  HEADING_1: `Loops in Python`,
  CONTENT_1: `Most of the actions in this world occur repeatedly. For example, if you have to walk one kilometer to reach a mall, you put your left and right foot forward, alternatively, to cover the distance. You repeatedly put each of your feet forward, one by one, a number of times until you reach the mall. Similarly in programming, you need to repeat a set of code multiple times more often than not. Loops help us to reduce this process of repetition. `,
  CONTENT_2: `In Python, the for loop is used to iterate over a sequence such as a list or string and other iterable objects such as a range.`,
  CONTENT_3: `Using a `,
  CONTENT_3_1: `for`,
  CONTENT_3_2: ` loop, we can iterate over each item in the sequence and execute the same set of commands for each item. This way we can automate and repeat tasks in an efficient manner.`,
  CONTENT_4: `Print the `,
  CONTENT_4_1: `Hello`,
  CONTENT_4_2: ` statement five times by repeating the statements. `,
  CONTENT_5: `Write a program to get the same output using a for loop.`,
  CONTENT_6: `Here `,
  CONTENT_6_1: `range(5)`,
  CONTENT_6_2: ` returns a list of numbers from 0 to 4, that is, five elements. Therefore it  repeats five times. So the `,
